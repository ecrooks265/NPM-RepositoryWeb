 NPM Dependency Intelligence Web

A local-first interactive tool to analyze, visualize, and understand your JavaScript project's dependencies — showing who maintains them and what security vulnerabilities exist.

Overview

This tool builds a live dependency graph from your project’s data, either by:

Uploading/pasting a local package-lock.json or similar dependency file, or

Searching an npm package name directly.

The graph then enriches that information using public APIs:

Maintainer Data — from the npm registry

 Vulnerability Data — via the OSV.dev
 database (and easily extendable to the Snyk API)

This helps developers quantify package trust, see who controls their supply chain, and spot risky dependencies before they impact production.

Setup Instructions
 Backend
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app:app --reload


Runs on http://localhost:8000

Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev


Runs on http://localhost:5173

Github setup:
first configure gh CLI with WSL or whatever distro you run the backend on (HTTPS or SSH doesn't matter as long as you're logged in)
Then set the environment variable so python os.env can find it
gh auth login to login to the gh CLI. Go to https://docs.github.com/en/rest/quickstart?apiVersion=2022-11-28 for more information
export GITHUB_TOKEN=$(gh auth token)
echo $GITHUB_TOKEN - to test it
